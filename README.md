arch-linux-rolling
=

Kernel for archlinux the way it meant to be.

With the expense of additional packaging and unpackaging and without [infamous bug](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/16702).

## installation

Note, if you installed `linux-rolling` after `linux-rolling_*`, you should manually regenerate `grub.cfg`.
